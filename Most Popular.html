                    A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided they see 
                    their victim's face and write their victim's name in a notebook called
                     a Death Note. One day, Ryuk, bored by the shinigami lifestyle and interested
                      in seeing how a human would use a Death Note, drops one into the human realm.
                            <br>
                     High school student and prodigy Light Yagami stumbles upon the Death Note and—since he deplores the 
                     state of the world—tests the deadly notebook by writing a criminal's name
                      in it. When the criminal dies immediately following his experiment with the
                       Death Note, Light is greatly surprised and quickly recognizes how devastating
                        the power that has fallen into his hands could be.
                           <br>
                     With this divine capability, Light decides to extinguish all criminals in order
                      to build a new world where crime does not exist and people worship him as a god.
                       Police, however, quickly discover that a serial killer is targeting criminals and,
                        consequently, try to apprehend the culprit. To do this, the Japanese investigators 
                        count on the assistance of the best detective in the world: a young and eccentric man 
                        known only by the name of L.

                    Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction 
                    by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide
                     in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly 
                     terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger 
                     but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants
                      of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years 
                      without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a 
                      colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight
                       for survival against the man-eating abominations.
                          <br>
                    After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands
                     of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their 
                     eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that 
                     combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime 
                     Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister
                      Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans
                       and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.

                    In the year 2022, virtual reality has progressed by leaps and bounds, and a massive online
                    role-playing game called Sword Art Online (SAO) is launched. With the aid of "NerveGear" technology,
                     players can control their avatars within the game using nothing but their own thoughts.
                            <br>
                     Kazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed "Kirito," is among the lucky few enthusiasts
                      who get their hands on the first shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, 
                      with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic 
                      medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon
                       realize they cannot log out; the game's creator has trapped them in his new world until they 
                       complete all one hundred levels of the game.
                              <br>
                     In order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact 
                     and cooperate with his fellow players. Some are allies, while others are
                      foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading group attempting to escape 
                      from the ruthless game. To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun
                       and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt to his
                        new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.

                                Hachiman Hikigaya is an apathetic high school student with narcissistic and semi-nihilistic tendencies.
                                 He firmly believes that joyful youth is nothing but a farce, and everyone who 
                                 says otherwise is just lying to themselves.

                                In a novel punishment for writing an essay mocking modern social relationships,
                                 Hachiman's teacher forces him to join the Volunteer Service Club, a club that aims to
                                  extend a helping hand to any student who seeks their support in achieving their goals.
                                   With the only other club member being the beautiful ice queen Yukino Yukinoshita, Hachiman
                                    finds himself on the front line of other people's problems—a place he never dreamed he would be.
                                     As Hachiman and Yukino use their wits to solve many students' problems, will Hachiman's rotten 
                                     view of society prove to be a hindrance or a tool he can use to his advantage?

                    On the surface, Koudo Ikusei Senior High School is a utopia. The students enjoy an 
                    unparalleled amount of freedom, and it is ranked highly in Japan. However, the reality
                     is less than ideal. Four classes, A through D, are ranked in order of merit, and only the
                      top classes receive favorable treatment.
                                <br>
                    Kiyotaka Ayanokouji is a student of Class D, where the school dumps its worst. 
                    There he meets the unsociable Suzune Horikita, who believes she was placed in Class
                     D by mistake and desires to climb all the way to Class A, and the seemingly amicable 
                     class idol Kikyou Kushida, whose aim is to make as many friends as possible.
                           <br>
                    While class membership is permanent, class rankings are not; students in lower
                     ranked classes can rise in rankings if they score better than those in the top ones.
                      Additionally, in Class D, there are no bars on what methods can be used to get ahead.
                       In this cutthroat school, can they prevail against the odds and reach the top?
